# Climb.AI - AI-Powered Learning and Career Development Platform

Climb.AI is an upcoming SaaS platform designed to provide AI-driven adaptive learning roadmaps, hands-on projects, and community support. Our mission is to help learners master both technical and non-technical skills while preparing them for career success. 

This project is currently in its early stages, and we're excited to build a comprehensive, unified learning experience for our users.

## Vision

The goal of Climb.AI is to create a personalized, adaptive learning journey for users pursuing careers in both technical and non-technical roles. The platform will integrate dynamic learning roadmaps, real-time AI support, career development tools, and a collaborative community to empower learners.

- **Project-Based Learning**: AI-suggested projects, coding challenges, and mock interview simulations.
- **Career Integration**: Mentorship matching, job search integration, portfolio builder, and career counseling tools.

## Micro SaaS Tools (Planned)

- **Skill Evaluation Tools**: Coding challenges, quizzes, and assessments to evaluate knowledge and progress.
- **Knowledge Tracker**: Tools to track learning milestones and visualize knowledge retention.
- **Interactive Code Playground**: A live coding environment with AI-assisted feedback and suggestions.
- **Interview Preparation Suite**: Coding challenges and mock behavioral interviews to help with job preparation.
- **Documentation Generator**: Auto-generated project documentation based on code structure.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB, Firebase
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js, Open source LLMs
- **Deployment**: Render, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Community Tools**: Discord

## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Initial Planning & Architecture
- **Next Steps**: Prototype development, platform architecture, and AI integration

We are actively planning and building the platform. Stay tuned for updates, and we welcome any early contributions or feedback!

## Getting Started

As the project is still under development, there's no live version yet. However, you can:

1. Clone the repository to stay updated:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/platform-name.git
    cd platform-name
    ```

2. Join our efforts! If you're interested in contributing, check out the **[Contributing](#contributing)** section below.

## Contributing

We welcome early contributions as we develop the platform! Feel free to open issues, suggest features, or submit pull requests. Please follow these steps to contribute:

### Step-by-Step Contribution Workflow:

1. **Fork the Repository**: 
   - Fork the repository (this will create a copy of the repo under your GitHub account).
   
2. **Clone the Repository Locally**:
   - Clone your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/climbai/user_platform.git
     cd user_platform
     ```

3. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-name
     ```

4. **Push Changes to the Original Repo's `dev` Branch**:
   - Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/climbai/user_platform.git
     git fetch upstream
     ```

   - Push your changes to your local branch of the forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-name
     ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the `dev` branch.
   - Make sure your PR includes a clear description of the changes and any relevant details.

6. **Review and Merge**:
   - After your PR is reviewed and validated, it will be merged into the `dev` branch.

### Branching Model:
- Developers should always create feature branches from `main`, push their changes to the `dev` branch for testing and review, and only after successful testing and approval, changes will be merged into `main`.

By following this workflow, we ensure that the `main` branch remains protected and stable, while `dev` is used for active development and testing.

Weâ€™re excited to have you contribute and help shape the future of Climb.AI! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
