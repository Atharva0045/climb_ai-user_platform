## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Initial Planning & Architecture
- **Next Steps**: Prototype development, platform architecture, and AI integration

We are actively planning and building the platform. Stay tuned for updates, and we welcome any early contributions or feedback!

## Getting Started

As the project is still under development, there's no live version yet. However, you can:

1. Clone the repository to stay updated:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/platform-name.git
    cd platform-name
    ```

2. Join our efforts! If you're interested in contributing, check out the **[Contributing](#contributing)** section below.



### Branching Model:
- Developers should always create feature branches from `main`, push their changes to the `dev` branch for testing and review, and only after successful testing and approval, changes will be merged into `main`.

By following this workflow, we ensure that the `main` branch remains protected and stable, while `dev` is used for active development and testing.

Weâ€™re excited to have you contribute and help shape the future of Climb.AI! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
